# Folior

Folior is a **self-hosted documentation and knowledge management app**, built with **Kotlin + Spring Boot** (backend) and **React + Tailwind** (frontend).  
It aims to provide a clean and lightweight alternative to tools like Notion or Outline, while remaining fully **open source** and **easy to deploy**.

## ‚ú® Idea

Organize and share knowledge in a simple and structured way:

- Create **workspaces** and **nested pages** for your documentation.
- Write with a **Markdown WYSIWYG editor** (headings, lists, code blocks, images).
- Upload and manage **attachments** (stored in S3/MinIO).
- Use **full-text search** to quickly find your pages.
- Export your whole workspace as **Markdown + assets** (ZIP).

Folior is designed to be **self-hosted in a homelab** or deployed in small teams.  
No vendor lock-in: your content always stays portable.
